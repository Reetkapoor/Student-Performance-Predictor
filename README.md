## Student Performance Prediction System

The main objective of this project is to understand how complete machine learning pipelines work. This is a learning project which was done following Youtube tutorial by Krish Naik. Dataset and basic approach are taken from his video for educational purposes.

### Tech Stack Used:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Implementation
- Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict student academic performance from structured datasets.
- Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to improve model reliability.
- Trained and evaluated multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Trees, etc).
- Deployed the best-performing model on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for inference.

### Result
- The best performance was given by the Linear Regression Model with an Accuracy of 88.04%
